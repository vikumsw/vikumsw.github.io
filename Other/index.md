<p style="text-align: left;">I absolutely love problem solving. I find solving algorithms, puzzles and riddles&nbsp;highly engaging.&nbsp;Below are a small collection of diversions that I find interesting, usually because their solutions are creatively simple.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Algo Challenges</strong></h2>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 21px;">

<h4>Count the Islands</h4>
<p><span>Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water. For example, this matrix has 4 islands. </span></p>
<p><span>1 0 0 0 0</span><br /><span>0 0 1 1 0</span><br /><span>0 1 1 0 0</span><br /><span>0 0 0 0 0</span><br /><span>1 1 0 0 1</span><br /><span>1 1 0 0 1</span></p>

<h4>String of Parentheses</h4>
<span>Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).</span></td>

<td style="width: 89.422%; height: 21px; border-style: solid;">
<h4>Can you make a palindrome from a given string</h4>
<p>Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.</p>

<td style="width: 89.422%; height: 21px; border-style: solid;">
<h4>Smallest Sparse Number</h4>
<p>We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. For a given input N, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N. Do this in faster than O(N log N) time.</p>

Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of wine is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible. However, the King has 10 prisoners he plans to execute. He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of wine contains the poison. The poison when taken has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. Hence he only has time for one round of testing. How can the King administer the wine to the prisoners to ensure that 24 hours from now he is guaranteed to have found the poisoned wine bottle?</span></td>
