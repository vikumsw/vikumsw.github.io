My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I used my time as an undergraduate to explore few different domains. Mentioned below are the publications I managed during the exploration.

### Selected Projects

* **Bandwidth Reduction and Convergence Analysis of Extremum Seeking Control with Feedback Encoding**  
<!---2015/16*-->
*Research Project: Dept. of Electronic and Telecom. Eng., University of Moratuwa*  
Instructor: Dr. Upeka Premarathne  
**Abstract:**  
ESC algorithms are used to track and maintain a plant/system at its most optimal operating point automatically without requiring the prior knowledge about the system and robust to smaller changes in the system. In this work we have analyzed the use of encoding schemes for Extremum seeking control systems which use periodic or stochastic perturbations.
*Paper Published In :* Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering

* **5Gbps SerDes IP Development for 100Gbps Applications**  
<!---*2015/16*-->
*Final Year Project: Dept. of Electronic and Telecom. Eng., University of Moratuwa*
Instructor: Dr. Subramanium Thayaparan 
**Abstract:**  
Successfully designed and simulated a Serializer-Deserializer module which is used to serialize parallel data which should be transmitted and to deserialize serial data into parallel lines at the receiver side  
*Paper Published In :* ISCAIE 2016

* **SHRUG : Stroke Haptic Rehabilitation Using Gaming**  
<!--- *2014/15*--> 
*Augmented Human Lab, Singapore University of Technology and Design*  
Instructor: Dr. Suranga Nanayakkara, Dr. Roshan Peiris  
**Abstract:**  
Augmented an existing exerciser to enhance rehabilitation process of stroke patients by adding visual feedback, gaming aspects and recording capability. This enabled patients to perform exercises correctly even without the supervision of a therapist and performance evaluation.  
*Paper Published In :* 6th Augmented Human International Conference 2015  

* **Paper Pixels**  
<!---*2014/15* -->
*Augmented Human Lab, Singapore University of Technology and Design*
Instructor: Prof. Geoff Gordon and Prof. Aarti Singh  
**Abstract:**  
Thermochronic ink changes its color based on the temperature. This idea was used to convert a paper based display in to an attractive animation by controlling the temperature on segments of the display.
