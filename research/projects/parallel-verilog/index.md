### Parallel Simulation of Verilog HDL designs

*Internship, IIT Bombay, Summer 2012*  
Guide: Prof. Sachin Patkar  

Digital designs, before synthesis, are simulated on a computer platform to test their efficiency. Maximizing the performance and minimizing the overheads is, therefore, a vital area of research. The main focus of this work is to parallelize the simulation of single clock structural/behavior hardware designs without any time or resource conflict. Thus, resulting in a multi-fold in reduction in execution time.

Due to advancements in the multi-core precessors, it is possible to simulate parallelizable designs faster. The flow of the work is briefly given below:
<ol class="proj-points">
<li>A given hardware design is converted into a standard XML structure. This allows the feasibility of using any description language (Verilog, in this case) for multi-platform compatibility.</li>
<li>This XML structure can be parsed in any high level language (Python) using standard libraries.</li>
<li>The design is systematically analyzed in the high level language to find functionally independent units.</li>
<li>These independent components are launched as seperate threads on a multi-core platform resulting in an overall reduction in time of simulation.</li>
</ol>

I have been awarded **Undergraduate Research Award** (URA 01) for contribution to research at IIT Bombay for this work.
Since this work has been done in close association with a graduate student, most of the implementation details can be found in his thesis report <a href="/reports/Digital-Reference.pdf">here</a>.
