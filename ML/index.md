<p style="text-align: left;">I find machine learning fascinating because it's fun, diverse, pervasive, not magic, creative, science and free!.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kaggle as a learning platform</strong></h2>
<p>In my early days into ML, I used kaggle heavily to gain knowledge in applied ML and achieved masters ranking tear in Notebooks. With my experience I recommend kaggle as one of the best go to places for beginners in ML. Following is some selected notebooks I compiled on kaggle.</p>
