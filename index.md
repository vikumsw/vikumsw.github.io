Hi!

I am a second year PhD student at [ECE](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/) department, [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I work with [Prof. Jos&eacute; Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/), in the fields of computer vision, natural language and machine learning. 

I have recently developed interests in understanding the semantics and semantic relatedness in language with the help of vision. 
I have also started collaborating with [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/) from Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/CVL.html)), Virginia Tech on learning semantics through abstract scenes.

I completed my undergraduate from Department of Electrical Engineering ([EE](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/)), [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), in 2014 along with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering ([CSE](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/)). I worked under [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/) on Human Activity Recognition for my undergraduate thesis.
