This is my take on "Data Readiness Levels" which is based on this wonderful [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02245), [blog post](http://inverseprobability.com/2017/01/12/data-readiness-levels), [talk](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/data-readiness-levels.html) and [webpage](http://data-readiness.org//) by Professor Neil Lawrence.
