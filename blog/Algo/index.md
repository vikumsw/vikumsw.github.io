Hi there!. Today I am going to analyse and solve an another beautiful programming puzzel. For those who are new here, I am a specialist software engineer in London Stock Exchange Group Technology who is really passionate about problem solving.

# Moving Robot : Is the robot on a circular path? 

## Problem:
On a infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0,0) and faces north. The robot can recieve one of three insructions: 'G': go straight 1 unit. 'L': turn 90 degrees to the left. 'R': turn 90 degrees to the right. The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever. return true if there exists a circle, in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle. Input: "GGLLGG". Ouput: True.

## Approach 1
* Project overruns can occur due to failure to account for the amount of time required to curate and collate. Also many failings on large data projects are associated with a failure to provision resources for the challenges involved in preparing our data, rather than a failing in the algorithmics of the system. Therefore, In project reporting, a major challenge is in encapsulating problems and enabling goals to be built around the processing of data.
* Also when preparing data is considered, we need to increase the accountability of the process and allow the nature of the data to be manifest.
