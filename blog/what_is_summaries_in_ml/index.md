Note : None of these are my own explanations and almost everything is collected from online resources. This is a useful collection of resources that are already available online.

## What is Symbolic AI?
* Symbolic AI involves the explicit embedding of human knowledge and behavior rules into computer programs.
* Symbolic AI (or Classical AI) is the branch of artificial intelligence research that concerns itself with attempting to explicitly represent human knowledge in a declarative form (i.e. facts and rules).
* "Symbolic AI" = "Classical AI" = "Rule-based AI" = "Good old-fashioned AI"

## What is Bayesian Inference?
* Bayesian inference refers to the application of Bayes’ Theorem in determining the updated probability of a hypothesis given new information.

## Frequentist Statistics
* Frequentist Statistics tests whether an event (hypothesis) occurs or not. It calculates the probability of an event in the long run of the experiment (i.e the experiment is repeated under the same conditions to obtain the outcome). Here, the sampling distributions of fixed size are taken. Then, the experiment is theoretically repeated infinite number of times but practically done with a stopping intention. For example, I perform an experiment with a stopping intention in mind that I will stop the experiment when it is repeated 1000 times or I see minimum 300 heads in a coin toss.

## Machine learning model
* Machine learning models are mathematical models which make weak assumptions about data, e.g. smoothness assumptions. By combining these assumptions with the data, we observe we can interpolate between data points or, occasionally, extrapolate into the future.

## Data Science
* Data science is an field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and etc to extract knowledge and insights from data.
* Data science differs from traditional statistics in that this data is not necessarily collected with a purpose or experiment in mind. In classical statistics the question is formed first, and data is collected to answer the question.

##  What Is Data Curation?
* Data curation is the work of organizing and managing a collection of datasets to meet the needs and interests of a specific groups of people.

##  What Is Data wrangling/Data munging ?
* Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes.

## What is A/B testing?  
* A/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology.  
* A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B.  
* A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is more effective.

## What is GPT-3?
* GPT-3 is a language model developed by OpenAI.
* GPT stands for “generative pre-training transformer”.
* It’s basically a language predictor: you feed it some content, and it guesses what should come next.
* Size of the model: 175 billion parameters.

## What’s a Fourier transform?
* A method to decompose functions into a superposition of symmetric functions.
* given a smoothie, it’s how we find the recipe.
* A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain
